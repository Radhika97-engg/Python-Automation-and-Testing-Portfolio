# Milestone 1: Python OOP Examples

This milestone covers foundational Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as:

- Class creation and initialization
- Method definitions
- Object instantiation
- Calculating slope, distance, surface area, and volume

These projects were done as part of a Python Bootcamp and demonstrate my understanding of modular and reusable code structures.
