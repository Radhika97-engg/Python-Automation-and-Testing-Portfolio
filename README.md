# Python Automation and Testing Portfolio

A hands-on portfolio of **Python-based validation and testing projects** tailored for roles in **Embedded QA**, **Automotive Validation**, and **Sensor Data Analysis**.

Each milestone simulates real-world engineering tasks like **log parsing**, **sensor validation**, **data cleanup**, and **error handling**— skills highly relevant to **validation engineers**, **QA analysts**, and **embedded testers**.

## Project Milestones

| Milestone | Project Title                   | Key Concepts Covered                          |
|----------:|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 01        | OOP Geometry Toolkit             | Object-Oriented Programming, `__init__`, `__str__` |
| 02        | CAN Log Parser                   | File Handling, CAN ID Filtering, Conditional Logic |
| 03        | Sensor Log Cleaner with Errors   | `try/except`, Log Sanitization, Fault Tolerance |

## Portfolio Highlights

- **Real-World Relevance** → Projects simulate embedded and automotive QA workflows.
- **Modular Milestones** → Each folder is a focused mini-project with its own README.
- **Practical Python** → Emphasizes error handling, automation logic, and log analysis.

---

## Sample Use Cases

- Detecting malformed CAN messages from a vehicle's diagnostic bus.
- Filtering valid sensor entries from mixed-quality log files.
- Practicing structured automation logic using OOP and file streams.
