# Milestone 2: CAN Log Parser in Python

This project simulates a real-world task in automotive validation — parsing raw CAN bus logs for signal-level analysis.

Key Features:
- Extracts message IDs and DATA bytes from CAN log files
- Filters messages by specific CAN ID
- Converts hex payloads into human-readable format

Relevance:
This tool mimics tasks performed by Validation Engineers while debugging signal issues in automotive or embedded systems.
